# snippets

This are tiny pieces of code that I did while praticing

File: Others contain the images I used.
div.html, flexbox.html, grid.html, images.html, nested-flexbox.html, position-absolute-relative.html, position.html all contain images.
It might look weird without the images

Each HTML and CSS snippet is connected by name. Ex: amazon.html is to be run with amazon.css

The Java rock, paper, scrissors project is to be run on its own. I use Eclipse to run it.
